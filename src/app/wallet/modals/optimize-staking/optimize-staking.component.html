        Staking NIX is based on transactions, so if you have lots of transaction with only a small amount of NIX in each, then by grouping them into fewer, larger transactions then you are likely to win stakes more quickly.
        <br>
        <br>
        You can also improve your staking chances further, if you choose to sweep up otherwise unavailable NIX, e.g. Ghost node rewards or transactions to ghost (‘G’) addresses. Ghosted NIX will not be staked however.
        <br>
        <br>
        Remember:<br>
        For any new transactions created you will need to wait for them to mature again before they start staking
